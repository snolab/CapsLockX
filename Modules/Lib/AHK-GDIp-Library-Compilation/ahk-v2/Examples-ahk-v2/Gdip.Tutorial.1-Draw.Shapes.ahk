; Set the width and height we want as our drawing area, to draw everything in. This will be the dimensions of our bitmap
Width :=1400, Height := 1050

; Create a layered window (+E0x80000 : must be used for UpdateLayeredWindow to work!) that is always on top (+AlwaysOnTop), has no taskbar entry or caption
;AHK v1
;Gui, 1: -Caption +E0x80000 +LastFound +AlwaysOnTop +ToolWindow +OwnDialogs
;Gui, 1: Show, NA
Gui1 := GuiCreate("-Caption +E0x80000 +LastFound +AlwaysOnTop +ToolWindow +OwnDialogs")
Gui1.Show("NA")

; Get a handle to this window we have created in order to update it later
hwnd1 := WinExist()

; Create a gdi bitmap with width and height of what we are going to draw into it. This is the entire drawing area for everything
hbm := CreateDIBSection(Width, Height)

; Get a device context compatible with the screen
hdc := CreateCompatibleDC()

; Select the bitmap into the device context
obm := SelectObject(hdc, hbm)

; Get a pointer to the graphics of the bitmap, for use with drawing functions
G := Gdip_GraphicsFromHDC(hdc)

; Set the smoothing mode to antialias = 4 to make shapes appear smother (only used for vector drawing and filling)
Gdip_SetSmoothingMode(G, 4)

; Create a fully opaque red brush (ARGB = Transparency, red, green, blue) to draw a circle
pBrush := Gdip_BrushCreateSolid(0xffff0000)

; Fill the graphics of the bitmap with an ellipse using the brush created
; Filling from coordinates (100,50) an ellipse of 200x300
Gdip_FillEllipse(G, pBrush, 100, 500, 200, 300)

; Delete the brush as it is no longer needed and wastes memory
Gdip_DeleteBrush(pBrush)

; Create a slightly transparent (66) blue brush (ARGB = Transparency, red, green, blue) to draw a rectangle
pBrush := Gdip_BrushCreateSolid(0x660000ff)

; Fill the graphics of the bitmap with a rectangle using the brush created
; Filling from coordinates (250,80) a rectangle of 300x200
Gdip_FillRectangle(G, pBrush, 250, 80, 300, 200)

; Delete the brush as it is no longer needed and wastes memory
Gdip_DeleteBrush(pBrush)


; Update the specified window we have created (hwnd1) with a handle to our bitmap (hdc), specifying the x,y,w,h we want it positioned on our screen
; So this will position our gui at (0,0) with the Width and Height specified earlier
UpdateLayeredWindow(hwnd1, hdc, 0, 0, Width, Height)


; Select the object back into the hdc
SelectObject(hdc, obm)

; Now the bitmap may be deleted
DeleteObject(hbm)

; Also the device context related to the bitmap may be deleted
DeleteDC(hdc)

; The graphics may now be deleted
Gdip_DeleteGraphics(G)
