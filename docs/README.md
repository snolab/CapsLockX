## Beginner's Quick Start Tutorial 📖 Tutorial

### Simple Quick Start Tutorial (Completion of this section is considered the beginning of mastering CapsLockX)

CapsLockX has four core functions: **window management**, **mouse emulation**, **arrow key emulation**, and application-specific hotkeys. This beginner tutorial will teach you the first three core functions.

First, get CapsLockX: download this zip file: [Download JSDelivrCDN - Release Package.zip](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/snolab/CapsLockX@gh-pages/CapsLockX-latest.zip)

After unzipping, open `CapsLockX.exe` within the CapsLockX folder, get past the simple beginner tutorial, and then try out the following functions in the left and right-hand feature areas to understand the capabilities of CapsLockX.

Once CapsLockX is started, it will **not affect** the functionality of other keys on your keyboard. The following features are triggered only when you press `CapsLockX + combination keys`.

Left-hand feature area:

- Window management: `CapsLockX + 1234567890` switches to the `n`th virtual desktop, `CapsLockX + ZXCV` for window operations (window switching, window closing, window arranging, transparency top-most).
- Mouse emulation function: Press `CapsLockX + WASD` to move the mouse (as simple as moving a character while playing a game), press `CapsLockX + QE` for left and right mouse clicks, `CapsLockX + RF` for scrolling up and down.

Right-hand feature area:

- Arrow key emulation: Open any text editor (such as Notepad), press `HJKL` to move the cursor, `YOUI` to move the page

After familiarizing yourself with the basic features, consult the quick reference guide below for more advanced functionalities.

- Press `CapsLockX+Space` at the same time to lock `CLX` mode, where `CLX` will be maintained until `CapsLockX` is pressed again next time. [Origin of Function](https://github.com/snolab/CapsLockX/issues/21)

### Module Description

CapsLockX by default loads some commonly used modules. The features and how to use them are listed below.
If you don't need certain modules, you can also directly delete the `.ahk` files in the `./Modules` directory, and then press `Ctrl + Alt + \` to reload.

You can also write your own `my-ahk.user.ahk` and put it in the `./User/` directory, and CapsLockX will automatically recognize and load them.

### Nightmares of Multitasking

#### Virtual Desktop Overview: Scenario Modes, Work Desks, Entertainment Desks, Project Categories...

Typically, a set of tasks a user is currently performing will include multiple windows. These windows combined can constitute a usage scenario, while multiple scenarios are likely to run at the same time, and some of them will run for a long time, without interference. This will involve a lot of window arrangement and virtual desktop switching operations, in these aspects, using CLX to manage your windows will bring a terrifying efficiency improvement.

Below are some examples of scenario combinations: Suppose you can study, work on several different jobs, chat with friends, play games, listen to BGM in the background, and have a paused movie ready to watch with family in the evening.

- Virtual desktop 1: Planning scenario: Schedule window + Multi-platform sync notes, e.g.: Google Calendar + Notion + Gmail.
- Virtual desktop 2: Learning scenario: Book reading window, note-taking window, e.g.: OneNote + Calibre, etc.
- Virtual desktop 3: Work scenario 1 (Front-end Development): Code editing + Documentation querying + Browser, e.g.: Chrome(dev) + VSCode + [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com), etc.
- Virtual desktop 4: Work scenario 2 (Back-end Development): Code editing + Documentation querying + Backend terminal + Database browser, e.g.: DBeaver + VSCode(+bash) + [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com), etc.
- Virtual desktop 5: Work scenario 3 (Script Development): Code editing + Documentation querying + Script target, e.g.: VSCode(+bash) + [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) etc.
- Virtual desktop 6: Work scenario 4 (3D Modeling and Rendering): 3D modeling software + Material searching, e.g.: Blender + Chrome.
- Virtual desktop 7: Work scenario 5 (3D Printing Slicing): Slicing software + Model searching window, e.g.: Cura + [thingiverse](https://thingiverse.com)
- Virtual desktop 7: Work scenario 6 (Video Processing): Editing + Material management, e.g.: PR + Everything.
- Virtual desktop 7: Work scenario 7 (Video Processing): Post-production + Documentation tutorial, e.g.: AE + Chrome.
- Virtual desktop 8: Writing scenario: Writing window, material referencing window, e.g.: Obsidian + Chrome (Google Scholar Index), etc.
- Virtual desktop 9: Communication scenario 1: Casual chats, e.g.: Telegram + Reddit + .
- Virtual desktop 9: Communication scenario 2: Work communication, e.g.: Slack + Skype + Gmail.
- Virtual desktop 9: Communication scenario 3: Presentation, e.g.: Google Meeting + (Vscode | Page application | Requirements document | Feedback document).
- Virtual desktop 0: Entertainment scenario 1: Playing games, e.g.: Age of Empires, Minecraft, Skyrim, Overcooked 2, etc.
- Virtual desktop 0: Entertainment scenario 3: Watching movies, listening to songs, e.g.: PotPlayer, Youtube Music, etc...
- ... More examples are welcome. Provide Issues or PRs for supplementation.

Snowstar does not recommend you handle too many tasks at the same time, but CapsLockX can save your thinking environment, greatly reducing the mental cost you incur during task switching, that is, saving you a lot of time rearranging windows and the resulting loss of attention.

(Note: If you like to handle many tasks at the same time, you might need not only a computer with not a small amount of memory but also a brain of significant capacity :D )

#### Enhancing the User Experience of Windows Window Switching - Win+Tab

When switching windows with Alt+Tab, if there are too many windows, a two-dimensional window pre-arrangement display will show up.
Generally speaking, Alt+Tab and Alt+Shift+Tab are purely left-handed keystrokes. If the user wants to select the window in the next line, they will instinctively press Alt+Tab many times.
However, the directional keys used for two-dimensional operations are often ignored because the right hand is usually on the mouse or on the J key.

Also, users will continue to hold down the Alt key after releasing the Tab key to browse the windows and select the target window to switch to.
In CLX, Alt+WASD will be used instead of the arrow keys to perform multiline window switching directly with the left hand, so there is no need to press Shift to go back to the left.
Moreover, if a user needs to clean up or close multiple windows, they simply press Alt+X to batch clean multiple target windows while remaining within the window browsing interface.

In CLX, these features greatly improve the usability of Alt+Tab.

#### TODO-Docs

<details>
<summary>Click to expand TODO-docs</summary>

#### Focus count: Active window, default active window, …

Each desktop has only one active focus window, and the virtual desktop can achieve automatic switching to the focus window of that virtual desktop when switching to it, achieving multiple task focuses (i.e., active windows).

### Simulated Mouse Plugin (WASD QERF)

> I have always prided myself on being a keyboard enthusiast, probably starting when I injured my finger joints while working on models, becoming a heavy keyboard user. Various keyboard acceleration tools, actively remembering various shortcuts, trying to use the mouse less, even learning vim and emacs. But many times, the mouse is irreplaceable, especially when graphical interfaces are prevalent.

—— The above is a quote from the author of [SimClick](https://github.com/rywiki/simclick), a project for simulating mouse actions through grid partitioning, which can complement this project.

—— Recommended by [Qin Jinwei](http://rsytes.coding-pages.com/)

## Features

- This module uses the key area: CapsLockX + QWER ASDF
- Very comfortably use WASD QE RF to simulate [full] mouse functionality, believe me, after trying this feel, you'll love it.
- The pointer automatically sticks to various buttons, hyperlinks when moved. The wheel's exponentially accelerating scrolling mechanism means you'll no longer fear super long articles and web pages.
- The effect is shown in the image:

\*Note: Double-clicking Left Shift+Ctrl+Alt is designed for remote desktops and virtual machines, allowing simultaneous display with the host desktop windows.
For example, with programs like mstsc.exe, TeamViewer, VirtualBox, HyperV, VMWare, and other remote desktop or virtual machine software, combined with the CapsLockX + Shift + V transparency and topmost feature, using interfaces like Linux or MacOS on Windows is no longer a challenge.

> Using CapsLock as the interface, it bridges the underlying logic, aligns Windows with Linux WM, and solves the pain points of Windows.

### Pomodoro Timer

25 minutes fixed cycle for rest reminders.

Use `CapsLockX + ,` to open the configuration, then change EnableScheduleTasks=1 to enable this plugin.

- Use Pomodoro chime (play a working bell sound at 00 and 30 minutes, and a rest bell sound at 25 and 55 minutes of every hour) (schedule tasks must first be enabled)

```ini
  UseTomatoLife=1
```

- When using Pomodoro chime, automatically switch desktops (rest desktop is 1, work desktop is 2)

```ini
  UseTomatoLifeSwitchVirtualDesktop=1
```

Note: If you only need the sound and do not need to automatically switch desktops, you can also try this Chrome plugin [Tomato Life - Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/25min-tomato-life/kkacpbmkhbljebmpcopjlgfgbgeokbhn)

Note: This plugin has been separated into an independent project, if you like the Pomodoro technique you can refer to the snow star's tomato-life project: [snomiao/tomato-life](https://github.com/snomiao/tomato-life)

### Auto Turn Off Screen When Locking

When pressing Win + L to lock the screen, immediately turn off the screen. This is suitable for automatically turning off the computer screen when preparing to sleep, so that it does not dazzle during the night...

## Past and Future 🛰

### Production Background (Autumn of 2017) 🍁 Background

> I often write code…
> At first, I was used to using the mouse with my right hand... later I found it a bit far to put the mouse on the right... so I switched to using the mouse with my left hand.
> After switching to the left hand, I realized I still had to take it off the keyboard... so I made a script that simulates the mouse with the WASD keys. (Then I could keep playing with the computer with my right hand under my chin)
> Later I wrote more and more scripts and put some of the common ones together to load...

### Development RoadMap 🛰️ RoadMap

The core philosophy of CapsLockX is to simplify system operation logic, improve operation efficiency, and not conflict with existing habitual key positions.

1. [x] Press CapsLockX + - key to display corresponding help (the current display style is quite rough)
2. [ ] i18n (eh this really should exist)
3. [ ] Auto-update (although git pull is also fine)
4. [ ] Tutorial for first-time users (this is a bit simple now...)
5. [ ] Plugin manager (although the file system could handle it too)
6. [ ] Auto-sync of configuration (though throwing it in OneDrive is usually enough)
7. [ ] A user-friendly options configuration UI (though changing ini isn't that hard)
8. [ ] Execute external code (Python, Nodejs, external AHK, Bash, …) (although running a script isn't much trouble)

### Key Combination Meaning Design ⌨ Chore Design

Win + series are generally used for operating system functions, desktop window application process management, input method, output device (display, multiple screens) management.

Alt + series typically denote invocation of application internal functions, their meanings should be equivalent to pressing the same function button, or jumping to a specific function interface.

Ctrl + series as above, but used more frequently and it's very likely that there is no button with the same function.

Ctrl + Alt + same as above, but generally for global hotkeys.

The Shift key is used to slightly change the meaning of the above functions (such as reverse operations like Shift+Alt+Tab, or extended function range like Shift+Arrow keys to adjust the selection, etc.)
