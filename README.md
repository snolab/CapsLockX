## Why?

CapsLockX was created to address several common frustrations that many computer users face on a daily basis. Here are some of the main reasons why CapsLockX exists:

1. **Efficient Window Management**: Modern computer usage often involves juggling multiple windows and virtual desktops, especially for professionals working on complex projects. CapsLockX provides intuitive hotkeys for managing virtual desktops and windows, making it easy to switch between tasks seamlessly without losing focus.

2. **Enhanced Text Editing**: Moving between the typing area and the editing control area can be cumbersome, especially for heavy typists or programmers. CapsLockX introduces Vim-like keybinds and other enhancements that allow for efficient text navigation and editing directly from the keyboard.

3. **Mouse Simulation**: Constantly switching between the keyboard and the mouse can disrupt workflow and lead to repetitive strain injuries (RSI). CapsLockX solves this by enabling comprehensive mouse emulation using the keyboard, allowing users to perform mouse actions with simple key combinations.

4. **Streamlined Shortcut Management**: Different applications often have their own sets of shortcuts, which can be hard to remember or inefficiently placed. CapsLockX provides a unified way to enhance and customize hotkeys within various applications, allowing for a more cohesive and efficient working environment.

5. **Mathematical Expression Calculation**: For users who frequently need to perform calculations, CapsLockX offers a way to quickly evaluate JavaScript mathematical expressions directly from the keyboard, streamlining workflows that involve frequent calculations.

6. **Multifunctional Customization**: CapsLockX is modular and highly customizable, allowing users to tailor the hotkey scripts to their specific needs. Whether you need specific functions for coding, writing, designing, or managing tasks, CapsLockX can be adapted to meet those requirements.

7. **Portable and Open Source**: CapsLockX is designed to be a portable tool that can be easily transferred and used across different systems. As an open-source project, it also provides transparency and community-driven improvements, ensuring that the software remains secure and continuously enhanced.

In summary, CapsLockX aims to make computer interaction more efficient, ergonomic, and customized to individual workflows, helping users operate like a **hacker** in movies, quickly achieving their tasks without breaking concentration.

## Beginner's Quick Start Tutorial üìñ Tutorial

### Simple Quick Start Tutorial (Completion of this section is considered the beginning of mastering CapsLockX)

CapsLockX has four core functions: **window management**, **mouse emulation**, **arrow key emulation**, and application-specific hotkeys. This beginner tutorial will teach you the first three core functions.

First, get CapsLockX: download this zip file: [Download JSDelivrCDN - Release Package.zip](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/snolab/CapsLockX@gh-pages/CapsLockX-latest.zip)

After unzipping, open `CapsLockX.exe` within the CapsLockX folder, get past the simple beginner tutorial, and then try out the following functions in the left and right-hand feature areas to understand the capabilities of CapsLockX.

Once CapsLockX is started, it will **not affect** the functionality of other keys on your keyboard. The following features are triggered only when you press `CapsLockX + combination keys`.

Left-hand feature area:

- Window management: `CapsLockX + 1234567890` switches to the `n`th virtual desktop, `CapsLockX + ZXCV` for window operations (window switching, window closing, window arranging, transparency top-most).
- Mouse emulation function: Press `CapsLockX + WASD` to move the mouse (as simple as moving a character while playing a game), press `CapsLockX + QE` for left and right mouse clicks, `CapsLockX + RF` for scrolling up and down.

Right-hand feature area:

- Arrow key emulation: Open any text editor (such as Notepad), press `HJKL` to move the cursor, `YOUI` to move the page

After familiarizing yourself with the basic features, consult the quick reference guide below for more advanced functionalities.

### Nightmares of Multitasking

#### Virtual Desktop Overview: Scenario Modes, Work Desks, Entertainment Desks, Project Categories...

Typically, a set of tasks a user is currently performing will include multiple windows. These windows combined can constitute a usage scenario, while multiple scenarios are likely to run at the same time, and some of them will run for a long time, without interference. This will involve a lot of window arrangement and virtual desktop switching operations, in these aspects, using CLX to manage your windows will bring a terrifying efficiency improvement.

Below are some examples of scenario combinations: Suppose you can study, work on several different jobs, chat with friends, play games, listen to BGM in the background, and have a paused movie ready to watch with family in the evening.

- Virtual desktop 1: Planning scenario: Schedule window + Multi-platform sync notes, e.g.: Google Calendar + Notion + Gmail.
- Virtual desktop 2: Learning scenario: Book reading window, note-taking window, e.g.: OneNote + Calibre, etc.
- Virtual desktop 3: Work scenario 1 (Front-end Development): Code editing + Documentation querying + Browser, e.g.: Chrome(dev) + VSCode + [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com), etc.
- Virtual desktop 4: Work scenario 2 (Back-end Development): Code editing + Documentation querying + Backend terminal + Database browser, e.g.: DBeaver + VSCode(+bash) + [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com), etc.
- Virtual desktop 5: Work scenario 3 (Script Development): Code editing + Documentation querying + Script target, e.g.: VSCode(+bash) + [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) etc.
- Virtual desktop 6: Work scenario 4 (3D Modeling and Rendering): 3D modeling software + Material searching, e.g.: Blender + Chrome.
- Virtual desktop 7: Work scenario 5 (3D Printing Slicing): Slicing software + Model searching window, e.g.: Cura + [thingiverse](https://thingiverse.com)
- Virtual desktop 7: Work scenario 6 (Video Processing): Editing + Material management, e.g.: PR + Everything.
- Virtual desktop 7: Work scenario 7 (Video Processing): Post-production + Documentation tutorial, e.g.: AE + Chrome.
- Virtual desktop 8: Writing scenario: Writing window, material referencing window, e.g.: Obsidian + Chrome (Google Scholar Index), etc.
- Virtual desktop 9: Communication scenario 1: Casual chats, e.g.: Telegram + Reddit + .
- Virtual desktop 9: Communication scenario 2: Work communication, e.g.: Slack + Skype + Gmail.
- Virtual desktop 9: Communication scenario 3: Presentation, e.g.: Google Meeting + (Vscode | Page application | Requirements document | Feedback document).
- Virtual desktop 0: Entertainment scenario 1: Playing games, e.g.: Age of Empires, Minecraft, Skyrim, Overcooked 2, etc.
- Virtual desktop 0: Entertainment scenario 3: Watching movies, listening to songs, e.g.: PotPlayer, Youtube Music, etc...
- ... More examples are welcome. Provide Issues or PRs for supplementation.

Snowstar does not recommend you handle too many tasks at the same time, but CapsLockX can save your thinking environment, greatly reducing the mental cost you incur during task switching, that is, saving you a lot of time rearranging windows and the resulting loss of attention.

(Note: If you like to handle many tasks at the same time, you might need not only a computer with not a small amount of memory but also a brain of significant capacity :D )

#### Enhancing the User Experience of Windows Window Switching - Win+Tab

When switching windows with Alt+Tab, if there are too many windows, a two-dimensional window pre-arrangement display will show up.
Generally speaking, Alt+Tab and Alt+Shift+Tab are purely left-handed keystrokes. If the user wants to select the window in the next line, they will instinctively press Alt+Tab many times.
However, the directional keys used for two-dimensional operations are often ignored because the right hand is usually on the mouse or on the J key.

Also, users will continue to hold down the Alt key after releasing the Tab key to browse the windows and select the target window to switch to.
In CLX, Alt+WASD will be used instead of the arrow keys to perform multiline window switching directly with the left hand, so there is no need to press Shift to go back to the left.
Moreover, if a user needs to clean up or close multiple windows, they simply press Alt+X to batch clean multiple target windows while remaining within the window browsing interface.

In CLX, these features greatly improve the usability of Alt+Tab.

Simulated Mouse Plugin (WASD QERF)

All along, I've always considered myself a keyboard aficionado, probably since I became a heavy keyboard user due to injuring my finger joints while modeling. I use various keyboard acceleration tools, actively memorize various shortcuts, and strive to minimize mouse usage, even learning vim and emacs. However, the mouse is irreplaceable, especially when graphical interfaces dominate.

- The above is a remark from the author of [SimClick Simulated Click](https://github.com/rywiki/simclick), a work that simulates the mouse in a grid subdivision manner and can complement this project.

- Recommended by [Qin Jinwei](http://rsytes.coding-pages.com/)

Features:

- This module uses key areas: CapsLockX + QWER ASDF.
- Very comfortably uses WASD QE RF to simulate complete mouse functionality. Trust me, once you try this tactile sensation, you'll love it.
- The pointer automatically sticks to various buttons and hyperlinks when moving. The exponential growth acceleration scrolling mechanism of the wheel ensures that you'll no longer fear excessively long articles and web pages.
- Effects as shown in the image: ![CLX-Mouse.gif](./docs/media/CLX-Mouse.gif)

Usage details as follows:

| Any Window   | `Double-click left Shift+Ctrl+Alt`    | Send the current window to the back \* see note below                        |

\* Note: Double-click the left Shift+Ctrl+Alt is designed for remote desktop and virtual machines, so that they can be displayed simultaneously with the local desktop windows. For example, mstsc.exe, TeamViewer, VirtualBox, HyperV, VMWare, etc., remote desktop or virtual machine programs, combined with the CapsLockX + Shift + V transparent always-on-top feature, allows you to simultaneously use Linux or MacOS interface on Windows interface without issue.

> Using CapsLock as a leverage, connecting the underlying logic, aligning Windows and Linux WM, solves the pain point of Windows usability.

(20220313) For situations where both ends are Windows, you can also consider using [RemoteApp Tool - Kim Knight](http://www.kimknight.net/remoteapptool) instead of remote desktop.

### Tomato Clock

25-minute fixed cycle break reminder.

Use `CapsLockX + ,` to open the configuration, then modify EnableScheduleTasks=1 to enable this plugin.

- Use tomato time notification (work bell rings at 00 and 30 minutes, rest bell rings at 25 and 55 minutes of each hour) (requires enabling scheduled tasks first)

  ```ini
  UseTomatoLife=1
  ```

- Automatically switch desktops when using tomato time notification (rest desktop is 1, work desktop is 2)

  ```ini
  UseTomatoLifeSwitchVirtualDesktop=1
  ```

Note: If you only need sound and do not need to automatically switch desktops, you can also try this Chrome extension [Tomato Life - Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/25min-tomato-life/kkacpbmkhbljebmpcopjlgfgbgeokbhn)

Note: This plugin has been separated into an independent project. If you like the Pomodoro Technique, you can check out Snomiao's tomato-life project: [snomiao/tomato-life](https://github.com/snomiao/tomato-life)

## Past and Future üõ∞

### Production Background (Autumn of 2017) üçÅ Background

> I often write code‚Ä¶
> At first, I was used to using the mouse with my right hand... later I found it a bit far to put the mouse on the right... so I switched to using the mouse with my left hand.
> After switching to the left hand, I realized I still had to take it off the keyboard... so I made a script that simulates the mouse with the WASD keys. (Then I could keep playing with the computer with my right hand under my chin)
> Later I wrote more and more scripts and put some of the common ones together to load...

### Development RoadMap üõ∞Ô∏è RoadMap

The core philosophy of CapsLockX is to simplify system operation logic, improve operation efficiency, and not conflict with existing habitual key positions.

1. [x] Press CapsLockX + - key to display corresponding help (the current display style is quite rough)
2. [ ] i18n (eh this really should exist)
3. [ ] Auto-update (although git pull is also fine)
4. [ ] Tutorial for first-time users (this is a bit simple now...)
5. [ ] Plugin manager (although the file system could handle it too)
6. [ ] Auto-sync of configuration (though throwing it in OneDrive is usually enough)
7. [ ] A user-friendly options configuration UI (though changing ini isn't that hard)
8. [ ] Execute external code (Python, Nodejs, external AHK, Bash, ‚Ä¶) (although running a script isn't much trouble)
9. [ ] Can be install with "irm https://get.capslockx.com | iex"

### Key Combination Meaning Design ‚å® Chore Design

Win + series are generally used for operating system functions, desktop window application process management, input method, output device (display, multiple screens) management.

Alt + series typically denote invocation of application internal functions, their meanings should be equivalent to pressing the same function button, or jumping to a specific function interface.

Ctrl + series as above, but used more frequently and it's very likely that there is no button with the same function.

Ctrl + Alt + same as above, but generally for global hotkeys.

The Shift key is used to slightly change the meaning of the above functions (such as reverse operations like Shift+Alt+Tab, or extended function range like Shift+Arrow keys to adjust the selection, etc.)
